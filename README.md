# Gomoku_proj

This is a project using search tree to play `gomoku` (aka. five in a row).
The code has bad strcture and the effiency is next to nothing.
That being said, you can still clone the repo and use

```
$ python chessboard.py
```

to run the code.

## Features
`UI` using tkinter

`multi-threaded backend` using native python

## What can I do with it?
~~Well, if you enjoy refactoring code, you can refactor it.~~

You can use it explore some basic gomoku ai approaches, but the code is not mature enough to be used in production.
